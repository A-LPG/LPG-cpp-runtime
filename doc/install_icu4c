1.install icu4c:
   brew install icu4c

2.Setting
icu4c is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS provides libicucore.dylib (but nothing else).

If you need to have icu4c first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/icu4c/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/icu4c/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find icu4c you may need to set:
  echo 'export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/icu4c/lib"' >> ~/.zshrc
  echo 'export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/icu4c/include"' >> ~/.zshrc

For pkg-config to find icu4c you may need to set:
  echo 'export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"' >> ~/.zshrc
